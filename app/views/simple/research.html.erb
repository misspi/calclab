    <p class="c3"><b>communimage</b> is a collaborative art project since 1999.
Thousands of people have since then contributed to a growing sea of images.
communimage is an attempt to entertain a visual global dialogue.<br /><br />

Statistic: 16.03.2009, 17:23<br />
Number of images: 25917<br />
Number of contributors: 2263<br />
Number of origin countries: 91<br /><br />

Printing size: 152.7552m2 (14.1024m x 10.848m)<br /><br />

The visual interface of communimage is a grid system that defines exactly the position of each image (128x128 pixel), that has been uploaded.
Each image (or "patch") carries a certain amount of meta information (added by the creator of the image). This meta information will be used to visualize facets of communimage.

    <p class="c3">The idea behind <b>erbse</b> is to risen the quality of database/search engines (DS) from the individual into the
visual and relational. We want to extend existent databases from their linear, stringent
structures to contextual and emotional tools to make other information and interest coherences
visible and communicable.<br /><br />
Starting point is the treasure of the DS, the search keys. The moment you enter a search key is
also an intuitive, emotional and personal one. In the very own method of searching you express
more than the wish to find the coherent result. As we know from our own enquiries often an
intuitively and spontaneously chosen search key leads to a more “profound” result than the
assumed logical linked one.<br /><br />
We propose, what is atypical for search engines, to give the search keys a visualisation, a
spatial contextual appearance in which the single enquiry operation is related and positioned in
to a dynamic global context with “all” the others inquiries and so generate a spatial and
contextual representativeness.<br /><br />
The basic idea is the “comparison of the search”.
What means that the visual links would be generated by the system treating search keys and
results not independent from each other but comparing the
content of meaning in the results and putting them in spatial relation.
The so visualized searchlandscape would be represented with typographic elements.<br />
On a first level there would be shown all relations between the search keys themselves by lines.
Every search key has a mouse over that contains further information like (entry date, time and
other from the same user entered search keys).<br />
On a second level there would appear all results belonging to this search key.
Showing the users the relational aspect of their operation and facilitating to see also the
connections to other users.</p>

    <p class="c3"> <b>geografia affettiva (geanet)</b> is about composing and
mapping the interrelation of life and how to provide each
member of a community/association/gang/group/band/etc.
with a tool to interact with the geanet-system and the other:
to in-form ("to put into form") his/her personal plan(s) and
map(s) as part of a whole visualised, multi-layered and
dynamic network.<br /><br />
using the technology of the telephone networks (cellular
phone networks/internet), the application provides the
possibility to translate his/her physical/spatial and
intellectual/spiritual moves (and the motivations behind them)
onto a web platform. this translation and mapping happens
directly when the member sends location- and (e)motionbased
information (sms, web-online-editing) about individual
spots, moments, movements, ways and stays.<br /><br />
the visual basics of geanet are maps/plans. each single
member develops his/her individual cartography by working
with the above mentioned technologies: his/her way in
space, in-between the poles of interest and affection
become digital and visual because they evolve into a
concrete physical state of being related. "individual
landscape" becomes "condividual datascape" and "I" takes
the shape of a knot in the networks of "yous".<br /><br />
hence geanet includes as a central feature, the possibility to
overlap these individual maps and layers of information: this
way, a member is able to create new kinds of versatile maps
based on information derived from the individual meta-data
of the community. his/her specific motivations, routes and
destinations draw spots, lines, curves and intersections. a
hyper-linked multi-layer-pattern of "all" ways and stays of a
community composed by the individual movements and
"meetings" of people, their imagination, wishes and
emerging projects :<br />
a transpersonal cartography > an affective geography.</p>
